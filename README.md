This is a NodeJS/Express backend for the react Trail Tracker app.  The app takes in trail data from a user and creates a trail profile in MongoDB and stores images for corresponding trail in AWS S3 Buckets.  The User can browse trails submitted by themselves and other users.  Each trail profile has an image slider of trail photos, displays current weather conditions for that trail and displays a map. This backend has end points for User signup, login, user account fetching.  It also has endpoints for adding a trail, deleting a trail, editing trails, fetching all trails and fetching an individual trail.
